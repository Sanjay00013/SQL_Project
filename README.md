# 🚀 SQL Project: Mastering Advanced Queries

## 📌 Project Overview
I successfully completed an **SQL project** where I explored a wide range of SQL concepts, from basic to advanced queries. This project was designed to enhance my skills in **writing efficient, optimized queries** while solving complex data problems.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Developed a strong understanding of SQL concepts and database relationships.
- Implemented advanced queries to extract meaningful insights from data.
- Created and structured a **custom dataset** with four interrelated tables.
- Optimized queries for performance and accuracy.

## 📚 About the Dataset
Since multi-table datasets were scarce on Kaggle, I created a custom dataset with **four tables**, designed specifically to practice complex SQL queries. The dataset structure was carefully crafted to include:

- **Patients**: Stores patient details such as name, date of birth, gender, and contact information.
- **Doctors**: Contains details of doctors, including their specialization and hospital affiliation.
- **Appointments**: Records patient appointments with doctors, including appointment date and status.
- **Medical Records**: Stores diagnosis, treatment, and prescription details for each patient.
- **Hospitals**: Maintains hospital details like name, address, and contact information.

## 🛠 SQL Concepts Covered
I implemented the following SQL techniques in this project:

1. **String Manipulation** – Extracting substrings, formatting text, and handling case sensitivity.
2. **Date and Time Functions** – Extracting and manipulating date/time values for analysis.
3. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** – Simplifying complex queries with temporary result sets.
4. **Window Functions** – Performing ranking, aggregation, and moving average calculations.
5. **Subqueries** – Nesting queries for data filtering and transformation.
6. **Joins & Relationships** – Establishing connections between multiple tables.
7. **Query Optimization** – Improving performance using indexing and efficient query structures.

### 📸 Project Screenshots
Here are some key screenshots showcasing different SQL concepts applied in the project:

 **Complex Join Queries** – Demonstrated relationships between multiple tables.



## 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used
- **PostgreSQL ** – Used for query execution and database management.
- **ERD Tools** – Designed and visualized database relationships.

## 📚 Key Takeaways
- **Gained hands-on experience** with writing complex queries and optimizing them.
- **Enhanced understanding** of database relationships and SQL best practices.
- **Designed structured datasets** and built relational databases from scratch.
- **Worked with CTEs, subqueries, and window functions** in real-world scenarios.
